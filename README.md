# Q&A Platform

## Description
The Q&A Platform is a simple, yet powerful web application designed to facilitate a question and answer ecosystem, similar to platforms like Stack Overflow or Quora, but streamlined for ease of deployment and customization. Using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this project allows users to post questions and contribute answers, fostering a community of knowledge sharing and learning.

## Features
- **Node.js and Express Framework:** Utilizes Express.js to handle server-side logic, providing a robust framework for web applications.
- **MongoDB for Data Storage:** Leverages MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, to store questions and their corresponding answers, facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **RESTful API Design:** Implements RESTful API endpoints for creating questions, posting answers to specific questions, and fetching all questions, adhering to best practices in API design.
- **Environment Variable Configuration:** Uses environment variables for database connection strings and server port, ensuring sensitive data is securely managed outside the codebase.
- **JSON Data Format:** Employs JSON for sending and receiving data, enabling easy integration with frontend frameworks or mobile applications.
- **Static File Serving:** Serves static assets from a predefined directory, allowing for the incorporation of frontend resources such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
